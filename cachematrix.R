## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
          set <- function(y) {
                  x <<- y
                  m <<- NULL
          }
          get <- function() x
        setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getSolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setSolve = setSolve,
             getSolve = getSolve)
}



## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- getSolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        setSolve(m)
        m
}
